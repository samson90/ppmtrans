Assignment 3 Design Document
Howard Kim and Cole Zuber

Part A -  
1. Same as the previous assignment
2. Same as the previous assignment
3. Same as the previous assignment
4. We will represent the 2d array of height h and width w as a single uarray 
   of length w x h.
Invariants:
The (i,j)th element is the ([i/b]*b^2 + [j/b]*b*w + b*[j%b] + i%b) element
in the single uarray, where b is the block size.i must not be greater than w, 
and j must not be greater than h.
5. Same as the previous assignment.
6. Same as the previous assignment.
7. Same as the previous assignment.

Part C -
1. Image transformation using two versions of 2d arrays.
2. Pbm images of varying sizes. We'll also be using Pnmrdr to read pixels.
3. Pbm files of the translated images.
4. Each translation will have its own function. Each type of array will have 
its own function for each tranlsation.
5. - The 2d array.
   - The width and height of the 2d array.
   - The coordinates and the index of target pixel.
   - The block size of the blocked 2d array.
6. - Our coordinate to index equation.
7. 2d grid.
8. See part A for representation of blocked 2d array.
9. See part A #4 for the invariant of blocked 2d array. 
   Loop Invariants:
       -Row-major - All pixels in rows above the current pixel and all pixels
           in the same row and left of the current pixel have been transposed.
       -Col-major - All pixels in colums to the left of the current pixel and
           all pixels in the same column and above the current pixel have been
           transposed.
       -Block-major - All pixels in blocks above the current row of blocks and
           all pixels in the blocks to the left of the current block have been
           transposed. Furthermore, all pixels in the same block that are in
           rows above the current pixel, as well as pixels to the left of the
           current pixel and are in the same row, have all been transposed.
10. - The algorithms for rotating 90, 180, and 270 degrees and flipping
      vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.
